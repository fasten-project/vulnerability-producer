  "message": "stek: differentiate initial state from valid time window of TOTP\n\nThere was a confusion in the TOTP implementation in stek.c.  When the\nmechanism is initialized at the first time, it records the timestamp\nbut doesn't initialize the key.  This removes the timestamp recording\nat the initialization phase, so the key is properly set later.\n\nSigned-off-by: Daiki Ueno <ueno@gnu.org>\n",
